# RaC‑Emu‑Addr‑Archive

Offline archive of PCSX2, PPSSPP, RPCS3 & Vita3K memory addresses for the Ratchet & Clank series, preserved for posterity.

## Contents

- `index.html` — main entry point to browse all archived pages  
- `assets/` — CSS, images and supporting files  
- other HTML pages and resources as mirrored via HTTrack

## Supported Platforms

- **PS2 (PCSX2)**  
- **PSP (PPSSPP)**  
- **PS3 (RPCS3)**  
- **Vita (Vita3K)**  

> Note: Emulator addresses include a platform‑specific prefix (2x for PCSX2, 3x for RPCS3, 4x for Vita3K). Console addresses omit the leading digit.

## Address Reliability

Some entries in this archive may not work on every setup—addresses were contributed and tested against specific emulator builds and game versions. This collection remains valuable because:

- **Value types are listed:** Each entry specifies whether it’s an integer, float, byte, etc.  
- **Effects are documented:** Addresses are tied to in‑game values (e.g., bolts, health, ammo).  
- **Quick recalibration:** Once you confirm a known address (such as bolts or health) in Cheat Engine, you can paste in the remaining addresses and automatically adjust offsets—saving you the heavy lifting of hunting each one down.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Navigate the offline mirror to view memory addresses, notes and contributor credits.  
4. To import into Cheat Engine or another trainer, copy the address list and recalculate offsets based on a confirmed anchor address.
